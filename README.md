# Tabloid - Fullstack

## Description

A group project to build a full-stack website with a focus on authorization/authentication and CRUD functionality. In the form of an online news platform where users can create articles, comment on articles, classify the articles and tag the article.

## Team Members

Sidney Crandall, Bre Coach, Laurel Morrison, Nicholas Patton and myself Chadwell Clark.

I worked mainly on User functionality and setting up admin / user access constraints as well as helping everyone else. We had a really awesome team, with great communication and Team focus!
